# Volkswagen

In the spring of 2012, I, along with my colleagues at Noc, updated Volkswagens custom made event handling system (developed by Noc). My part of the work was to implement a number of new features such as drag and drop sorting, drag and drop uploading of images, created a default theme for the event information that are sent to Volkswagenâ€™s customers, enabled the invitation of extra people, etc.

The event system is used by Volkswagen to create and manage corporate events for Volkswagen dealers and their customers. The system is unfortunately not public so I cant post any link here.

The system was built in Kohana
