# Tobaksfakta

In the spring of 2012 I implemented and launched Tobaksfaktaâ€™s new layout which was developed by my colleagues at the time at Noc web agency. The site is built in wordpress and in my work with the site, I have partly helped them to restructure the flow of information on the page to make it less cluttered (I also improved the workflow when working with the content on the site). The main work was done by creating a custom wordpress theme with PHP, HTML and CSS.
