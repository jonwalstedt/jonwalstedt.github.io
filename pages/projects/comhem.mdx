# ComHem

In spring 2010, I developed a web interface to allow ComHem visitors to see how ComHem’s tv boxes work.

The application was a remake of a previous touch screen application developed on Ambient media. The web application was a easy way to let the customers see how the GUI on ComHem’s digital receivers worked and how to navigate through the menus and use the various functions of the receiver.
