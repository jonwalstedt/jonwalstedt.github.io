# Lydmar hotel

I’ve rebuilt Lydmar Hotels website to make it easier for them to work with the page. In the process, I’ve developed a new wordpress theme and restructured the site to get search engine friendly urls and clear hierarchies. I’ve also updated the layout and the design used on the site.

This page is located at http://www.lydmar.com

The site was built 2012
