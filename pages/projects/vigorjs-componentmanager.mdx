# Vigorjs ComponentManager

VigorJS ComponentManager is a small framework that I built during the autumn 2015. It is intended to help decouple and simplify the application structure of large scale Backbone applications.

Read more about this framework and see it in action here: http://jonwalstedt.github.io/vigorjs.componentmanager/
