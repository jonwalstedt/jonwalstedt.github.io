# SVT Play

I am currently working as a developer at SVT Play â€“ developing their TV applications: Smart TV application (HBB), Apple TV and Android TV.

The main responsibility is to develop a new Smart TV application using React and GraphQL. The application is written in TypeScript and compiled down to a HBB compatible format.
