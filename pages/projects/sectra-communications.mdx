# Sectra Communications

In the spring 2012, I, along with Dennis Germundal and my other colleagues at Noc, built the site Sectra Communications. The page, which is built in Drupal, is available in two languages, and have a responsive layout.

My part in this development was both frontend and backend, but alot of my time was spent on doing the responsive layout.
