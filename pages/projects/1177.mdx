# 1177

When I was working at Ambient media my colleague Jonas and I developed an iPhone and Android app for Barnavårdscentralen (BVC), and 1177. The goal was to provide information to parents about the health care provided by BVC and 1177. The application allowed the parents to add stats about their child’s development and then compare it against 1177s stats, see films from 1177, post your own events on the child’s timeline etc.

The app was built using modern web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3) and then packaged with Phonegap and then published on the Appstore and Android Market.
