# Autodesk

I worked as a software developer in the Tools team at Autodesk’s Stockholm office. The team was responsible for the development of all the plugins and editors included in the Stingray game engine – a 3D and real-time game engine used for games, visualizations, VR, AR, etc.

My main task was to build the UI architecture used for Stingray’s new entity editor from the ground up. The entity editor is an editor for graphically managing entity hierarchies in the 3d engine.

The work was done with functional programming in ES6, view management in Mithril (https://mithril.js.org/) and custom built state management inspired by Redux.
